# clearCacheLiferayRobot

Hi! I'm Nicolas, the clearing cache robot!
I'm going to help you by clearing DataBase Cache of all cluster nodes at Liferay 6.2 site.
Be sure you are connected at Customer VPN.
If you get some handshake error try changing your internet connection from wi-fi to 4G.
Nice to meet you!
